title: Using fopen in iOS

### Problems with fopen in Objective-C

Today, I began integrating my Objective-C project with some C code that uses `fopen` to read and write to files in a local directory. For example:

{% highlight c %}
FILE *fp = fopen("log.txt", "a");
if (fp) {
    fprintf(fp, "--- Begin Log ---\n");
}
{% endhighlight %}

Unfortunately, these calls do not work in iOS projects -- all calls to `fopen` without a specific path result in a `NULL` return value.

### Wrapping fopen

The easiest solution to this problem that I found was to wrap `fopen` with an iOS-specific implementation that will automatically prepend the application's documents folder to the path. Here's the implementation I used:

{% render_gist https://gist.github.com/raw/4616532/37dbeb9e27392eb1d517430790fd60a37907f661/utilities.m %}

### Using iosfopen

`iosfopen` works as a very basic drop-in replacement for `fopen` for your C files that require a diretory for writing.

For example, the code in the first section could be replaced with this:

{% highlight c %}
#include "utilities.h"

// ...

FILE *fp = iosfopen("log.txt", "a");
if (fp) {
    fprintf(fp, "--- Begin Log ---\n");
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Caveats

Note that `iosfopen` is not very robust and does not respond well to paths that resolve to a parent directory (e.g. `../logs/log.txt`). These paths will reside outside of the application's writable space, which will result in a `NULL` file descriptor.
